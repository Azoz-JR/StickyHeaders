# StickyHeaders
Dive into the realm of sticky headers with this SwiftUI View Modifier.
Offering not just one, but three dynamic options to elevate your app's user interface! Whether you prefer a single sticky header at the top, multiple concurrent headers neatly stacked under each other, or a cascading effect where each header pushes the previous one to the top â€” this repository has you covered.

## Key Features:
- **Single Sticky Header:** Keep it clean with a single header that stays fixed at the top of the scroll view.
- **Multiple Concurrent Headers:** Opt for a more layered approach with multiple sticky headers neatly arranged on top of the screen.
- **Pushing Headers:** Experience a dynamic effect where each header pushes the previous one to the top, creating a visually appealing cascade of sticky headers.
